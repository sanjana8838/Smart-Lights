# Smart-Lights

We can conserve energy in many ways and at the many differently levels of energy consumption.
At the commercial level, updating older buildings with new, more efficient technology can help reduce the amounts of electricity required to power a business. 
This project was inspired by the prospects of sensors and how such minimal effort is all it takes to step towards a greener future by creating a solution that can be used by every building in the world: Smart Lights.

## Hardware Used
1.	UltraSonic Motion Sensor
2.	Light Intensity Sensor
3.	NodeMCU
4.	LEDs

## Implementation
The Two sensors were integrated using the NodeMCU and LEDs were used as the light source in the room whose intensity has to be Adjusted based on Ambient light and switched on based on motion in the room. 
An Additional feature to the pre-Existing Adaptive lighting solutions that we offer is the constant update of the time slots in which the light was left switched on and thus the amount of electricity used, per day.
